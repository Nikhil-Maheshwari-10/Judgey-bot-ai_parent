# Judgey Bot üò§

Judgey Bot is an interactive Streamlit app that acts as your AI "disappointed parent." It asks probing, judgmental questions about your habits and life choices, then delivers sarcastic, guilt-inducing feedback‚Äîculminating in a final, comprehensive verdict. It's all in good fun (and maybe a little motivation)!

## Features

- **Conversational AI:** Uses Gemini 2.0 Flash via [LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm) to generate context-aware, judgmental questions and responses.
- **Session Memory:** Remembers your answers and uses them for increasingly pointed questions and judgments.
- **Final Judgment:** After 8 questions, delivers a comprehensive, disappointed-parent-style verdict.
- **Fallbacks:** If the LLM is unavailable, fallback questions and responses keep the experience going.
- **Streamlit UI:** Clean, interactive web interface with stats and playful design.
